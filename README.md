# CRC-Card-Creator-Tool
Class Responsibility Card Creator Tool that allows software engineers to make use of CRC models to help brainstorm object oriented projects

Class Responsibility Card Models were created by American software engineers Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck to enable software engineers the ability to brainstorm object oriented software by utilizing flash cards which are sectioned into three parts to display a classes name, responsibilities, and collaborators. These flash cards are then brought together to create a model which represents either part of a software, or the whole to allow engineers to brainstorm how various classes may interact with one another.

The purpose of this tool, is to enable software engineers to create CRC models easily by filling out a classes name, responsibilities, and collaborators on as many cards as they want.
If the user wishes, they can add more cards allowing this webpage to support everything from the smallest to largest of object oriented projects.
The user can also remove cards if they change their mind or would like to start over on a Class Responsbility Card.
Finally, the user may print their cards in the end to allow them to use their newly created cards, and begin their brainstorming physically.
